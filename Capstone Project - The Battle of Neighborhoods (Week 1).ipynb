    "The success of establishing a new restaurant depends on several factors: demand, brand loyalty, quality of food, competition, and so on. In most cases, a restaurant’s location plays an essential determinant for its success. Hence, it is advantageous and of utmost importance to determine the most strategic location for establishment in order to maximize business profits.\n",

    "A client seeks to establish a franchised Asian restaurant, with a niche in Southeast Asian cuisine, in a Toronto neighborhood. Which neighbourhood would appear to be the optimal and most strategic location for the business operations?\n",
    "The objective of this capstone project is to locate the optimal neighborhood for operation. Our foundation of reasoning would be based on spending power, distribution of ethnic group, and competition, across each neighbourhood. We will mainly be utilizing the Foursquare API and the extensive geographical and census data from Toronto’s Open Data Portal.\n",

    "Fellow entrepreneurs seeking to either establish a new restaurant of a certain niche or have plans to expand their franchised restaurants would be very interested in the competitive advantages and business values this finding can potentially reap.\n"
